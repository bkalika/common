Don’t use database.

Create /home link (without Blueprint) and add a template.

Products
Supermarkets

Create 2 Blueprint modules: Products, Supermarkets and register them in app. They must have their own template folders.

Products Blueprint:

Links:

/product - user can add product [POST], Get all products[GET]. Add Filter argument support (if user will put ?price=10
you should return only products with price 10).

/product/
<id> - user can get particular product[GET].

    Product structure:
    [
    {
    “id”:”...”,
    “name”: “...”,
    “description”: “..”,
    “img_name”: “..”,
    “price”: “...”
    },
    ….
    ]

    Product Templates:

    all_products.html - marked list of products (each product is a link to the product page.html).
    There must be link Add product that redirect to add_product.html page.
    There must be link to the Home page.(somewhere, you can put in in nav or footer, turn on your feeling of
    beautiful))))

    product.html - There might be name of the product (h1), it’s price, description, and img. (put all images to the
    static folder in your blueprint module and get it by using url_for and img_name from product).
    There must be links to the Home page and All Products page.

    add_product.html - POST form with name, description, img_src and price. Don’t forget to generate id and add it to
    the product before it saves.

    Supermarket Blueprint

    Links:

    /supermarket - user can add supermarket [POST], Get all supermarkets[GET]. Add Filter argument support (if user will
    put ?location=”Kyiv” you should return only supermarkets that are in Kyiv).

    /supermarket/
    <id> - user can get particular supermarket[GET].

        Supermarket structure:
        [
        {
        “id”:”...”,
        “name”: “...”,
        “location”: “..”,
        “img_name”: “..”
        },
        ….
        ]

        Supermarket Templates:

        all_supermarkets.html - marked list of supermarkets (each supermarket is a link to the supermarket.html).
